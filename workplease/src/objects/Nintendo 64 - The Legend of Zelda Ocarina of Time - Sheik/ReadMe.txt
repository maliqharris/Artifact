This model was ripped by Zerox.
Because of the way N64 models are rendered some textures repeated and others did not.
So to make the model work properly in all 3D programs of the modern day I have combined the texture and adjusted the UV as neccessary.
No credit necessary though I really prefer if you do give me credit. 
If you do something cool with the model send me a private message on Spriter's Resource, I'd love to see.
